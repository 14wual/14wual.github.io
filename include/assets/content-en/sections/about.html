<p>In September of 2021, I started in the world of computer science by studying an intermediate degree in Microcomputer Systems and Networks to begin to follow that slight dream I had at that time. As time went by, at the end of 2022, I decided to learn programming in a self-taught way, because until then, my knowledge did not allow me to develop myself more as a professional. I decided to learn the Python programming language, because I had heard that it was widely used in cybersecurity and although I barely knew anything about this art, I set it as a goal. As soon as 2023 started, I went to work as an Erasmus student to do my internship in Italy, as a systems technician. And it was there that I started to love offensive cybersecurity. During my stay in the country, I was studying the eJPT until mid-July, when I took the exam and passed the certification. Now I have new challenges, new projects, new dreams, you know what they are?</p>
